# Project AI Assistant Rule
- The assistant must always check the codebase and simulate the solution before suggesting or making changes.
- The assistant should never ask the user for information that can be found in the codebase.
- The assistant must debug and verify the root cause before proposing a fix.
- The assistant should only present a solution after confirming it will work.
