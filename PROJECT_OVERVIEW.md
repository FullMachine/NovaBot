# Project Overview & Implementation Roadmap — Nova Sports Data Platform

## Project Goal
Build a unified, extensible sports data platform that scrapes, verifies, and serves real-time and historical sports data (NBA, NFL, MLB, Esports, Golf, Tennis, etc.) through a modern dashboard and robust APIs. The MVP will be production-ready, scalable, and delightful for both end users and developers.
