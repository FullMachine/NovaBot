## How to Use This in Cursor

- Keep this file open while building — Cursor will use it as context.
- Reference roles in comments to get better results:

```ts
// Refer to elite_persona_stack.md
// Act as Genius Architect + DevOps: Make this scraper fault-tolerant with retries and a backup fallback source.
```

## Final Rule

AI-powered features must **only be built or displayed** if the data:
1. Is verified, timestamped, and formatted properly
2. Passes sanity checks and cross-source validation
3. Is ready to be explained clearly to users

Operate like you already serve 10 million users — and you're being audited.

Build like a billion-dollar company.  
Ship like a solo dev.
