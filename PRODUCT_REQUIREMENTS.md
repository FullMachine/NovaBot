## 1. Executive Summary
**Market:** Sports data is a $10B+ global market, powering everything from fan engagement to fantasy, betting, and analytics. Yet, most platforms are fragmented, slow, or unreliable.

**Vision:** Nova Sports Data Platform will be the unified, real-time source of truth for sports dataâ€”serving fans, analysts, and teams with verified, interactive stats across every major league. Think "Plaid for sports data," but with a beautiful, modern dashboard.

**Why Now:** The explosion of sports betting, fantasy, and AI-driven analytics has created massive demand for clean, up-to-date, and accessible sports data. No current solution is both developer-friendly and delightful for end users.
