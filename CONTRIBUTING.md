# Contributing Guide â€” Nova Sports Data Platform

Welcome! We use a structured, high-trust workflow to ensure quality and speed. Please follow these steps for all contributions:

## 1. Understand the Product
- Read `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md` to understand the product, rules, and agent system.

## 2. Plan Your Work
- Before starting any feature or bugfix, create a workplan in `docs/Plans/` using the `WorkplanTemplate.md`.
- Name your file like `FEAT-FeatureName.md` or `BUG-BugName.md`.

## 3. Implement
- Follow your workplan checklist.
- Update the status and notes as you go.
- Reference the architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and UX/UI plan (`UX_UI_PLAN.md`) as needed.

## 4. Test
- Write and run automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) for all changes.
- Ensure all tests pass locally and in CI.

## 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- PRs must include a completed workplan in `docs/Plans/`.
- Link your PR to the relevant workplan and reference any related issues.
- The CI will check for a workplan file and passing tests.

## 6. Review & Merge
- Address feedback promptly.
- Only merge when all checks pass and the workplan is marked as "Completed".

## Proposing Features or Filing Bugs
- Open an issue and (optionally) draft a workplan for discussion.
- Use the workplan template for clarity.
