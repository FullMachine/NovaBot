# UX/UI Plan — Nova Sports Data Platform

## 1. High-Level Design Philosophy
- **Minimalist, data-rich, and modern.**
- Prioritize clarity, speed, and delight—no clutter, only what matters.
- Use whitespace, clear hierarchy, and bold typography for instant scan-ability.
- Visuals (charts, avatars, logos) support—not distract from—data.
- Playful micro-interactions (hover, tap, carousel) for engagement, but never at the expense of speed.
- Mobile-first, but beautiful on desktop.

## 2. User Flows (Core Features)
- **Browse Top Players:**
  - Home → Select Sport → See Top Players Carousel → Flip/Swipe → View Player Details
- **Search & Filter:**
  - Home → Search Bar → Type Query → Filter by Sport/Team/Stat → Results List → Player/Game Detail
- **Favorite/Watchlist:**
  - Any Player Card → Click Favorite/Watchlist → Confirmation Toast → Access via Profile/Sidebar
- **Data Verification:**
  - Admin → Verification Tab → View Discrepancy Reports → Drill Down → Export/Resolve
- **Resume Scraping:**
  - Admin → Scraper Dashboard → See Progress Bar → Resume/Retry Button

## 4. Component Patterns
- **Card Layouts:** Player, Team, Game (with image, stats, actions)
- **Carousel:** Top Players (arrows, swipe, auto-scroll)
- **Search Bar:** With filters, clear button
- **Modals:** Player stats, add to watchlist, confirm actions
- **Graphs:** Line/bar charts for stats (use chart.js or recharts)
- **Progress Bars:** For scraping, loading
- **Tabs:** For switching between stats, games, teams
- **Toasts:** For feedback (favorite added, error, etc.)
- **Toggle Switches:** Dark mode, filter toggles
- **Dropdowns:** Sport/team/season selectors
- **Tables:** For detailed stats, sortable

---

## 5. Layout Notes
- **Top Nav:** Sport selector, search, profile, dark mode toggle
- **Sidebar (Desktop):** Quick links to sports, favorites, admin (if role)
- **Mobile:** Bottom nav for main sections, swipeable carousels
- **Grid System:** 12-column, responsive breakpoints for cards/lists
- **Sticky Elements:** Progress bar, nav on scroll

---

## 6. States to Consider
- **Empty:** No data ("No players found. Try another filter.")
- **Loading:** Skeleton screens, animated placeholders
- **Error:** Clear, actionable ("Failed to load. Retry?")
- **Success:** Toasts, checkmarks, subtle animations
- **Partial Data:** Show what's available, flag missing

---

## 7. Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All actions/tab stops accessible
- **Screen Reader Labels:** aria-labels on all interactive elements
- **Contrast:** Meet/exceed WCAG AA (use contrast checker)
- **Font Size:** Min 16px, scalable
- **Alt Text:** All images/logos
- **Focus States:** Visible, high-contrast

---

## 8. Design Tools
- **Figma:** For wireframes, prototypes, and design system
- **Storybook:** For live component library (dev handoff)
- **Framer:** For advanced prototyping (optional)

---

## 9. Style Guide Basics
- **Fonts:** Inter, SF Pro, or similar; bold for headings, regular for body
- **Colors:**
  - Primary: #3B82F6 (blue), #111827 (dark bg), #F9FAFB (light bg)
  - Accent: #F59E42 (orange), #10B981 (green)
  - Error: #EF4444, Success: #22C55E
- **Shadows:** Subtle, for card elevation

## Figma Wireframe Suggestions & Layout Instructions
- **Start with mobile wireframes, then expand to desktop.**
- **Use auto-layout for all cards, nav, and lists.**
- **Create a Figma component library:**
  - PlayerCard, TeamCard, GameCard, Carousel, SearchBar, Modal, Toast, ProgressBar, TabNav, Table
- **Wireframe Flow:**
  - Landing → Sport Dashboard → Player Carousel → Player Detail → Add to Favorites
  - Search → Results → Player/Team/Game Detail
  - Admin → Scraper Dashboard → Progress Bar/Logs
- **Annotate all wireframes with intended states (empty, loading, error, success).**
- **Export all icons and images as SVG for crispness.**

**This plan is your blueprint. Build the Figma file, then hand off to devs with confidence.**
