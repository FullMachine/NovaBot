## Task ID
FEAT-WorkplanSystem

## Problem Statement
There is no standardized, trackable system for planning, executing, and documenting feature and bugfix work in this project. This leads to inconsistent implementation, lack of traceability, and potential for missed requirements or poor communication.

## Proposed Implementation
Implement a Task Planning and Execution System that requires a dedicated workplan file for every new feature or bugfix. Each workplan will follow a strict template and be stored in `docs/Plans/`. The system will be documented and enforced as part of the team workflow. Testing will include verifying the presence and completeness of workplan files for all new PRs, and ensuring the template is followed.

- Add a `docs/Plans/` directory for all workplans.
- Create a markdown template for workplans (as described).
- Update onboarding and contribution docs to require workplans for all new features/bugfixes.
- Add a CI check to verify workplan presence and structure for new PRs.
- Test by creating a sample workplan and running the CI check.

## Components Involved
- Documentation (docs/Plans/)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Onboarding/Contribution docs
- All feature/bugfix PRs

## Dependencies
- Markdown rendering (for docs)
- GitHub Actions (for CI check)
- Team buy-in for new workflow

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `docs/Plans/` directory
- [ ] Write workplan markdown template
- [ ] Update onboarding/contribution docs
- [ ] Add CI check for workplan presence/structure
- [ ] Create sample workplan file
- [ ] Test CI check with sample PR

## Verification Steps
- [ ] Run CI on a PR with and without a workplan file to confirm enforcement
- [ ] Manually review sample workplan for template compliance
- [ ] Confirm onboarding docs reference the new system

## Decision Authority
- Template and CI logic can be decided independently
- Any changes to required fields or enforcement level require user approval

## Questions/Uncertainties
### Blocking
- None
### Non-blocking
- Should the template be enforced for hotfixes? (Assume yes for now)

## Acceptable Tradeoffs
- Slightly slower PR process in exchange for better documentation and traceability
- Manual review of workplan content is acceptable for MVP

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
- This system will improve team communication, onboarding, and project quality.
- Can be extended to auto-generate changelogs or release notes in the future.
